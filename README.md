# Ethereum_Payments_Application

# Blockchain_Ledger_System

[This application is a blockchain based ledger system created through Python and the front-end library Streamlit](https://rrmangum-blockchain-ledger-system-pychain-yq41hj.streamlitapp.com/). It allows a user to enter various data and then add blocks (data containers) to a chain of blocks (list). The data is hashed using the SHA256 hashing algorithm from hashlib. The blockchain includes the hash of the previous block in each new block to ensure the chain remains un-altered.
